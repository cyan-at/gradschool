  fbd -> lagrange -> euler-lagrange (equations of motion)
  (equations of motion) -> manipulator / mass-matrix derivations
  split into unactuated / actuated joints
  pfl
    manipulating / deriving / solving
    the equations of motion / manipulator matrices s.t.
    some of the q** = A
  collated / noncollated pfl 
    if collated pfl, we are solving the manipulator equations
    s.t. y (estimated sys output) = actuated q, so we control to converge / track actuated q

    if noncollated pfl, we are solving the manipulator equations
    s.t. y (estimated sys output) = unactuated q, so we control to converge / track unactuated q (cool)

  feedback linearization explanation
    use a nonlinear feedback to cancel out nonlinearities in system
    so we turn controlling a nonlinear system
    to controlling a linear one
      which we can PID control / track
      because PID control converges error to 0


what we've done for (partial) feedback linearization is say

let y = tau = d22 q2** + h2 + phi2
