    "Scientists speculate that beneath its thick icy surface, [Jupyter's moon Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)) has huge salty water ocean that stays in liquid phase due to tidal effects. Some believe that Europa's subsurface ocean is a promising place to harbor extraterrestial life.\n",

All coordinates are measured w.r.t. a fixed reference frame (which is irrelevant for this problem). Upon landing, all rovers detect that a source located at **unknown location** $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is emitting biochemical signal. Specifically, the sensors onboard the rovers measure the noisy range $r_i$ between the source and the $i$th rover:\n",
